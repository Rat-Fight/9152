    Rat Fight Robotics Team is a dedicated group of volunteers and student workers at Berea College, competing in the FIRST Robotics Competition. More than just building robots, we focus on mentorship and hands-on learning, training high school students in the key aspects of robotics:

Mechanical Design & Fabrication â€“ Constructing durable and efficient robot structures.
Software & Programming â€“ Developing intelligent control systems and automation.
CAD (Computer-Aided Design) â€“ Designing precise models before building.
Electrical Systems â€“ Wiring and integrating essential electronic components.
Our goal is to inspire the next generation of engineers and problem-solvers by fostering innovation, teamwork, and technical excellence. Through training, building, and competing, we prepare both ourselves and our students for real-world challenges in STEM.

Join us as we train, build, and competeâ€”shaping the future of robotics, one challenge at a time! ðŸš€ðŸ¤–
